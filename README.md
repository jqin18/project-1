#For this project, we invesitgated the 5 year performance (trade volume and market captilisation)of some iconic cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, #Dogecoin and Stellar (This is our first research question).
#We compared their performance with VIX and analysed the correlation between the two. In addtion, we also asked 3 more research questions: 
#2.Which to invest? Coin or Token? Minable or not?
#3. Will the traditional investment methods impact the performance of Bitcoin?
#4. Which region in the world has the highest total value of cryptocurrency?

#To answer all of these questions and visualise our result, we updated this main repo with 8 pieces of python code, below is a breakdown of each file and what question they were intented to answer.
